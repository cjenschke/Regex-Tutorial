## Regex Components

### Anchors

- Anchors are regex elements that don't match any characters but define specific positions with the text. The two common anchors are the caret `^` and the dollar sign `$`.

  `/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/`

  - Caret (^) Anchor

    - In our email validation regex the caret `^` anchor is used at the beginning of the pattern to assert that the matching text must start at the beginning of a string. It ensures that the email address must start with the username component and not with any preceding characters.

  - Dollar ($) Anchor

    - In our email validation regex the `$` anchor is used at the end of the pattern to ensure that the match must end at the end of the string. In this case, it ensures that the email address must end with the top-level domain (TLD) component and not have any additional characters after it.

- These anchors ensure that the entire email address is checked from start to finish, providing a precise match. In the context of email validation, they help make sure that the email format adheres to the rules throughout the string.

### Quantifiers

- Quantifiers control the number of times a character or a group of characters can appear in a pattern. They determine whether a specific element should be matched once, multiple times.

  - `+` Quantifier
    `: [a-z0-9_\.-]+`

    - The `+` quantifier means "one or more." In this example one or more lowercase letters (`a-z`), digits (`0-9`), underscores (`_`), periods (`.`), or hyphens (`-`) must be used in the username component of the email address. This ensures that there must be at least one character before the `@` symbol.

  - `*` Quantifier
    `[\/\w \.-]*`

    - The `*` quantifier means "zero or more." In this example zero or more characters can be slashes (`/`), word characters (`/w` included letters, digits, and underscores), spaces(`  `), periods (`.`), or hyphens (`-`). This is used for the optional path or query component in a URL that may follow the domain.

  - `{2,6}` Quantifier
    `[a-z\.]{2,6}`

    - The `{2,6}` quantifier allows specifying a range of repetitions. In this example, matches between 2 and 6 lowercase letters (`a-z`) or periods (`.`) in the top-level domain (TLD) components of the email address. This ensures that the TLD is 2 to 6 characters long.

- These quantifiers play a crucial role in specifying the allowed patterns for different parts of an email address, making sure they match the desired format while accommodating variations.

### OR Operator

- In email addresses, the OR operator can be used to handle variations in the local part (before the "@" symbol) or domain part (after the "@" symbol). For example, email domains can be either generic top-level domains (gTLDs) like ".com" or country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) like ".uk".

  `/^(example|test|user)@(gmail\.com|yahoo\.com|hotmail\.com)$/`

  - The `^` marks the beginning of the string.

  - `(example|test|user)` Thss part of the regex used the OR operator `|` to match variations in the local part. It will match if teh local part is "example," "test,", or "user."

  - The `@` matches the "@" symbol in the email address.

  - `(gmail\.com|yahoo\.com|hotmail\.com)` This part used teh OR operator to match different domain options. It will match if the domain part is either "gmail.com," "yahoo.com," or "hotmail.com."

  - The `$` marks the end fo the string.

- In this OR operator example the regex pattern will validate email addresses like "example@gmail.com," "test@yahoo.com," or "user@hotmail.com." You can adjust the options within the `()` to match specific variations you want to allow in email addresses. The OR operator provides flexibility in handling different formats while ensuring they conform to the expected pattern.

### Character Classes

- Character classes are used to define a set of characters that can match at a specific position in the string. In email validation regex, we use character classes to match certain character ranges within the username and domain components.

  - Username Component `/[a-z0-9_\.-]+/`

    - In this part of the regex, we use character classes to define the valid characters for the username portion of the email address.

    - `[a-z]` This character class matches lowercase letters (a-z).

    - `[0-9]` This character class matches digits (0-9).

    - `_` this matches the underscore character.

    - `\.` This matches the period character.

    - `+` The plus sign indicates that one or more of these characters must appear in the username.

  - Domain Component `/[\da-z\.-]+/`

    - In the domain part of the regex, we again use character classes to define valid characters.

    - `[\da-z]` This character class matches lowercase letters and digits.

    - `\.` This matches the period character.

    - `+` The plus sign indicates that one or more of these characters must appear in the domain.

- By using character classes in these components, we specify which characters are allowed and create a pattern for valid email addresses. For example the email address "john.doe@example.com" will match the username "john.doe" and the domain "example.com" based on the character classes.

### Flags

- Flags in regular expressions are modifiers that affect how the regex pattern is matched. In the context fo email validation, two common flags are the `i` (case-insensitive) and `g` (global) flags.

  - Case -Insensitive Matching (`i` flag)

  ```javascript
  const emailRegex = /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/i;

  console.log(emailRegex.test('user@example.com')); // true
  console.log(emailRegex.test('User@Example.com')); // true
  console.log(emailRegex.test('UPPERCASE@EXAMPLE.COM')); // true
  ```

  - The `i` flag makes the regex pattern match case-insensitively. For email validation, this allows both uppercase and lowercase characters in email addresses. In the above code snippet by putting the `i` flag at the end of the regex pattern (`/i`) ensures that both uppercase and lowercase characters can be used.

  - Global Matchings (`g` flag)

  ```javascript
  const text =
    'Contact us at user1@example.com or user2@example.com for assistance.';
  const emailRegex = /([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})/g;
  const emailMatches = text.match(emailRegex);
  console.log(emailMatches);
  ```

  - The `g` flag is used when you want to find all matches in a given string rather than stopping after the first match. This can be useful in scenarios where you need to find and extract multiple email addresses from a larger text. In the code snippet above, we define the `emailRegex` with the `g` flag (`/g`). When we use `text.match(emailRegex)` it returns an array of all email addresses found in the `text` string.

- These flags provide additional flexibility and functionality when working with regular expressions for email validation.

### Grouping and Capturing

- In the context of email validation, grouping helps organize different segments of the email address, such as the username, domain, and TLD.

  `/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/`

  - `([a-z0-9_\.-]+)` This group captures the username part of the email address. It matches one or more lowercase letters, digits, underscores, hyphens, or dots.

  - `([\da-z\.-]+)` This group captures teh domain part of teh email address. Again it matches one or more lowercase letters, digits, underscores, hyphens, or dots.

  - `([a-z\.]{2,6})` This group capture the TLD. It matches between 2 to 6 lowercase letters or dots, which is typically the domain extension (e.g., com, org).

  - By using these groups, we can extract and use the captured values in our code.

    ```javascript
    const emailRegex = /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/;
    const email = 'example@email.com';
    const match = email.match(emailRegex);

    if (match) {
      const username = match[1];
      const domain = match[2];
      const tld = match[3];

      console.log('Username:', username);
      console.log('Domain:', domain);
      console.log('TLD:', tld);
    } else {
      console.log('Invalid email address');
    }
    ```

    - In this example, the `match` method is used to find the captured groups in the email address. Grouping and capturing make it easier to work with complex patterns like email validation, allowing you to extract specific parts of the matching text for further validation or processing.

### Bracket Expressions

- Bracket expressions allow us to specify a set of characters that we want to match within our regex pattern. In email validation we use character classes to define allowable characters for different parts of an email address.

  `/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/`

  - `[a-z0-9_\.-]` This character class matches lowercase letters (a-z), digits (0-9), underscores (\_), periods (.), and hyphens (-). Any character within this set is considered valid in the username.

  - `[\da-z\.-]` This character class matches digits (\d), lowercase letters (a-z), periods (.), and hyphens (-). This allows for alphanumeric domain names, periods for subdomains, and hyphens for hyphenated domain names.

  - `[a-z\.]{2,6}` This character class matches lowercase letters (a-z) and periods (.) and quantifies them with `{2,6}` to ensure that the TLD portion of the email address has between 2 and 6 characters. this helps ensure that TLDs like .com, .org, or .co.uk are matched correctly.

  ````javascript
  // Match the username part of an email address
  const usernameRegex = /[a-z0-9_\.-]+/;
  const username = 'john_doe123'; // Replace with an actual username
  if (usernameRegex.test(username)) {
    console.log('Username is valid');
  } else {
    console.log('Username is invalid');
  }

    // Match characters in the domain part of an email address
    const domainRegex = /[\da-z\.-]+/;
        const domain = "example.com"; // Replace with an actual domain
    if (domainRegex.test(domain)) {
    console.log("Domain is valid");
    } else {
    console.log("Domain is invalid");
    }

    // Match the top-level domain (TLD) of an email address
    const tldRegex = /[a-z\.]{2,6}/;
    const tld = "com"; // Replace with an actual TLD
        if (tldRegex.test(tld)) {
    console.log("TLD is valid");
    } else {
    console.log("TLD is invalid");
    }```
  ````

  - In this example it demonstrates how you can use character classes to match and validate different parts of an email address. The character classes define the valid character sets for usernames, domains, and TLDs, allowing you to check whether each part of the email address conforms to the expected format.

### Greedy and Lazy Match

- Greedy Match. In email validation, you can use greedy matching to capture the longest possible sequences for components like the domain name.

  `/^(.+)@(.+)$/`

  - `^` and `$` anchors ensure that the entire string is matched.

  - `(.+)` captures the username part of the email address.

  - `@` matches the "@" symbol.

  - `(.+)` captures the domain part of the email address.

  - With this regex, the username and domain parts will capture as much as they can until they reach teh "@" symbol. For example, for the email "john.doe@example.com" the username will capture "john.doe@example" and the domain will capture "com."

- Lazy Match. In email validation, you can use lazy matching to capture the shortest possible sequence.

  `/^(.+?)@(.+?)$/`

  - `^` and `$` anchors ensure that the entire string is matches.

  - `(.+?)` captures the username part of the email address.

  - `@` matches the "@" symbol.

  - `(.+?)` captures the domain part of the email address.

  - With this regex, the username and domain parts will capture the shortest sequences possible while still forming a valid email address. For example, for the email "john.doe@example.com" the username will capture "john.doe" and the domain will capture "example."

- Using greedy and lazy matching in your email validation regex gives you control over how much text is captured by the regex components, allowing you to adapt the regex to your specific needs.
