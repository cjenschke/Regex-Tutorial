# Solving the Email Validation Puzzle with Regex

Summary

In this tutorial, we will dive into the world of regular expressions and explore how to validate email addresses using a specific regex pattern. The regex we'll be focusing on is:
`javascript`
`/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/`

## Summary

Briefly summarize the regex you will be describing and what you will explain. Include a code snippet of the regex. Replace this text with your summary.

## Regex Components

### Anchors

- Anchors are regex elements that don't match any characters but define specific positions with the text. The two common anchors are the caret `^` and the dollar sign `$`.

  `/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/`

  - Caret (^) Anchor

    - In our email validation regex the caret `^` anchor is used at the beginning of the pattern to assert that the matching text must start at the beginning of a string. It ensures that the email address must start with the username component and not with any preceding characters.

  - Dollar ($) Anchor

    - In our email validation regex the `$` anchor is used at the end of the pattern to ensure that the match must end at the end of the string. In this case, it ensures that the email address must end with the top-level domain (TLD) component and not have any additional characters after it.

- These anchors ensure that the entire email address is checked from start to finish, providing a precise match. In the context of email validation, they help make sure that the email format adheres to the rules throughout the string.

### Quantifiers

- Quantifiers control the number of times a character or a group of characters can appear in a pattern. They determine whether a specific element should be matched once, multiple times.

  - `+` Quantifier
    `: [a-z0-9_\.-]+`

    - The `+` quantifier means "one or more." In this example one or more lowercase letters (`a-z`), digits (`0-9`), underscores (`_`), periods (`.`), or hyphens (`-`) must be used in the username component of the email address. This ensures that there must be at least one character before the `@` symbol.

  - `*` Quantifier
    `[\/\w \.-]*`

    - The `*` quantifier means "zero or more." In this example zero or more characters can be slashes (`/`), word characters (`/w` included letters, digits, and underscores), spaces(`  `), periods (`.`), or hyphens (`-`). This is used for the optional path or query component in a URL that may follow the domain.

  - `{2,6}` Quantifier
    `[a-z\.]{2,6}`

    - The `{2,6}` quantifier allows specifying a range of repetitions. In this example, matches between 2 and 6 lowercase letters (`a-z`) or periods (`.`) in the top-level domain (TLD) components of the email address. This ensures that the TLD is 2 to 6 characters long.

- These quantifiers play a crucial role in specifying the allowed patterns for different parts of an email address, making sure they match the desired format while accommodating variations.
